        Kenyan golfer who wants to give Woods a run for his money.<br><br>

        Wangari is a class three student at Makini School.<br>
        By the way, she turns nine in September but before then she wants to have<br>
        won the the US Kids Golf World Championship that will be held in Pinehurst, North Carolina from July 30th to

                old’s
                do</h3>
            <div class="facts__about">
                <p>She goes to class during the week and has homework which she endeavors to finish by
                    Friday afternoon so she can play golf.</p><br>

                <blockquote><em>“It is a lot of running, we have to make it to practice a bunch of times in a week.
                    There
                    are a lot of early mornings and cramped schedules, especially ahead of a big tournament, but
                    Chanelle
                    loves golf, which makes it all worth it,”</em></blockquote>

                <p>says Maureen Wangari, Chanelle’s mother.</p><br>

                <p>Wangari says she enjoys school very much.</p><br>

                <blockquote><em>“I love math, numbers are really fun. They help me with golf, you can see how you’re
                    doing
                    in the game, just by using math problems.”</em></blockquote>

            <div class="facts__about">
                When Wangari is on the golf course, the game is the only thing on her mind. Yes! No getting distracted.
                When she plays at the US Kids Golf World Championship,
                it will be her first time to travel to the US.<br><br>

                This is what Wangari said when I asked her what she wanted to know about North Carolina.
                <blockquote>“How is the humidity? It will affect the distance I can hit the ball.
                    I really can’t wait to go to Disney World, right after the competition we are going there and I am
                    so excited!”

                To qualify for the US Kids Golf World Championship, Wangari had to be top three in the Africa Junior
                Golf Championship that was held in South Africa in September 2014. She has played in Malaysia and will
                travel to Italy in October of 2015
                to play.<br><br>

                <blockquote><em>“I’m very excited to go to Europe to golf. I haven’t been there before and I want to
                    play on their courses, I hear they’re really beautiful,”</em></blockquote>

                    school. The trainers came to us and told us to Chanelle wanted to give golf a shot and we were
